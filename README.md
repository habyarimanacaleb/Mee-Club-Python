# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Calculator

This project combines a **Rock, Paper, Scissors game** with a **Calculator system** by introducing a `Person` class. Each user can both play the game and perform calculations, with the program maintaining a history of both calculations and game results. This project demonstrates foundational Python concepts like **print functions, variables, loops, conditionals, functions, dictionaries, classes, and objects**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Person Class**: Represents a user who can:
  - Play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
  - Use the calculator for various arithmetic operations.
  - Maintain separate histories for game results and calculations.
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**:
  - Two-player mode or player vs. computer.
  - Winner determination system with history tracking.
- **Calculator Functionality**:
  - Supports operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
  - Stores calculation history using a dictionary.
- **Continuous Gameplay and Calculation Loop**.
- **User-Friendly CLI Interaction**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main file containing all functionalities and the program loop.
- `Person`: A class that manages users, their calculation history, and game history.
- `Functions`: Handles game logic, calculations, and menu interactions.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter their name to create a profile.
2. The program offers five options:
   - Perform a calculation.
   - View calculation history.
   - Play Rock, Paper, Scissors.
   - View game history.
   - Exit the program.
3. Each userâ€™s actions and results are stored in history.
4. The user can view their past calculations or game results at any time.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
- Python 3.x

## ðŸ“– Usage
Run the program using:
```
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations or play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Improvements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add more mathematical operations to the calculator.
- Enhance the game by including advanced game rules or multiplayer mode.

## ðŸ“œ License
This project is open-source and available for educational purposes.
